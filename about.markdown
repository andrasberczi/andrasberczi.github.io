Hi!

My name is Andras Berczi. I work as a Data Scientist, currently for Emarsys in Budapest, Hungary.

Nowadays, with LLMs all around, information can be found very easily, so my main goal with these blogposts is an exercise for myself: to see if I understood a topic well enough to explain it to others. But in the meantime, I hope you find them useful too!
