When preparing for an experiment it is very important to know what we can expect from it.

One important aspect is to know how much uplift we can actually measure, eg.: we could be happy with 1% uplift from our experiment, but there isn't a chance to measure such uplift with the amount of data we have. I wrote a blogpost about the topic on Emarsys Craftlab, [check it out](https://blog.craftlab.hu/checking-both-sides-the-minimum-detectable-effect-f34a6c0db4fb)!
